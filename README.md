Dear @Mosamee Sonkhede Ma’am,

I believe we have already received approval from Nayan Ma’am. We now need to proceed with the next steps for my deputation letter.
As you know, my EMS claim is pending because the deputation letter has not yet been issued.

I kindly request you to provide the deputation letter at the earliest convenience.
