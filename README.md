Subject: Leave Request for Durga Puja

Dear All,

I would like to celebrate Durga Puja with my family and also attend to some personal work. Therefore, I would like to take leave from 22nd September to 3rd October.

I have many pending tasks at home, which I plan to complete during this leave. To ensure that our official work is not affected, I am willing to work on Saturdays if required.

Thanks and Regards,
Jitender
