jHere's a well-rounded Achievement/Comment you can use for this CUSTOMER KPI:


---

"Maintained a strong focus on quality by thoroughly following all defined reference guides, checklists, and quality processes. Delivered error-free outputs with minimal rework, ensuring 'first time right' deliverables. Ensured compliance with safety standards, codes, and customer-specific requirements, leading to positive feedback and enhanced customer satisfaction. Regularly reviewed and cross-checked work to prevent functional or technical issues and contributed to maintaining the overall quality of project deliverables."

If you'd like to add a specific project or metric (like defect-free rate), I can help you revise it accordingly.
