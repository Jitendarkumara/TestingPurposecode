Hereâ€™s your corrected version with improved grammar and clarity:

1. Added a dropdown list to display data in the chart based on the selected mill.


2. Modified the code to fetch data from the PIMS table instead of the EMS table, as per the new design in the updated table.


3. In the CCL application, modified the code to handle errors caused by server disconnection issues.


4. In the GP application, we received a new coil with five zeros, so we updated the procedure to handle this change.


5. We are facing multiple difficulties due to signal loss in the CCL application. To resolve this, we are working on creating a new HMI that will allow users to set or modify data according to the current coil.


6. In the Tube Mill application, added a symbol as an indication to help users easily understand whether the PLC is running or not (PLC status).
