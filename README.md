Subject: Request for Compensatory Off

Respected Sir/Madam,

I would like to bring to your kind notice that I had worked on 15th August 2025 (Independence Day) and 27th August 2025, which were official holidays. As per the company policy, I was eligible to receive compensatory off for these working days.

However, I could not apply for the compensatory off in time due to unavoidable reasons. I kindly request you to consider my case and grant me the compensatory off for the above-mentioned days.

I shall be grateful for your kind support and consideration.

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
[Your Full Name]

[Department]
