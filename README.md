Subject: Request to Update Attendance – Approved Time Off

Dear Admin Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I had missed submitting a time-off request in the previous month’s attendance records. However, the leave has now been approved by Mandar Sir and Nidhi Ma’am.

Kindly update the attendance accordingly and consider the mentioned days as present for the payment process.

Thank you for your support and understanding.
