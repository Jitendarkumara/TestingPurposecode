Hereâ€™s a suggestion for what you can write under Achievements/Comments for that KPI if you have performed well:


---

"Consistently met all assigned deadlines throughout the review period. Demonstrated strong time management and prioritization skills by delivering key tasks on or before agreed timelines. Maintained regular communication with stakeholders to ensure alignment on deliverables and timelines. Actively incorporated feedback for continuous improvement. No major delays reported in task completion."


---

If there were any challenges but you still managed them well, you can say something like:


---

"Faced some timeline challenges due to unforeseen dependencies but ensured proactive communication and collaboration to mitigate delays. Majority of tasks delivered within agreed timelines. Continuously worked on improving efficiency and process adherence."


---

Would you like help tailoring it based on your actual performance?
