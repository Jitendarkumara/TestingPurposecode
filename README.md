Hereâ€™s a grammatically corrected version of your questions:

1. We have four values mentioned below. Which option should we use to display the KWH value and for generating alerts?

QID-KWH

Average Voltage Line-to-Line, Current Phase Average

Active Power

Power Factor Signed



2. Should USL (Upper Specification Limit) and LSL (Lower Specification Limit) be applied to the sum of all feeders or separately for each feeder?


3. In the chart, should the KWH data be displayed as the sum of all parameters or for a specific parameter?


4. On page load, how many days of data should be displayed in the chart?



Let me know if you'd like any further refinements!
