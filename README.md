Sure! Here's a strong example of an Achievement for the CUSTOMER target related to CFF/CSI score and stakeholder management:


---

Achievement (CFF/CSI Score â€“ Customer Relationship Management):
Maintained a high Customer Feedback Form (CFF) and Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) score by building strong relationships with clients and project stakeholders. Ensured clear and consistent communication, addressed concerns proactively, and delivered on expectations, contributing to enhanced client trust and long-term engagement.

If you have exact CFF/CSI scores, names of stakeholders, or examples of initiatives you took, I can fine-tune this further. Want to add more detail?
