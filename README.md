Dear Akith,

I hope you’re doing well.

As per our discussion in yesterday’s meeting regarding the message structure, I would like to schedule a follow-up discussion to finalize the screen layout. Please let me know a suitable time when we can sit together.

I can come to your location, or you are welcome to meet me at the admin office—whichever is more convenient for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
