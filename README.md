Subject: Request for Compensatory Off

Respected Sir/Madam,

I would like to bring to your kind notice that I am deputed at Tata Steel, Khopoli, and I had worked on 15th August 2025 (Independence Day) and 27th August 2025 (Ganesh Chaturthi), which were official holidays at Tata Steel. My timesheet has been maintained accordingly. As per the company policy, I am eligible to receive compensatory off for these working days.

However, I could not apply for the compensatory off in time due to unavoidable reasons. I kindly request you to consider my case and grant me the compensatory off for the above-mentioned days.

I shall be grateful for your kind support and consideration.

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
[Employee ID]
[Department]

‚úÖ This version is grammatically correct and professional.

Do you also want me to make an email subject line suggestion (short & clear) that will look professional when you send it by mail?
